# Digit Recognizer

------

This repo includes my Ipython notebook of my take on Kaggle's [Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) (aka MNIST data set).  It reaches 0.995 accuracy on the test set, which is within [top 10%](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/leaderboard) at the time of writing.  I used PyTorch to implement a convolutional neural network.
